<h1>Skills & Experience</h1>

<h2>Languages</h2>
<hr>

<h3>English</h3>
<p>Native speaker, completely fluent. If I didn't like coding, maybe I'd be a writer.</p>

<h3>Français</h3>
<p>I was in a French Immersion program for two years, and I took the language throughout highschool. Some of my friends
    come from Québec. I'm not fluent by any means, but I can understand basic sentences with difficulty. I'm actively
    working on improving my grasp of the language by following francophones on social media and listening to French
    podcasts.</p>

<h3>Python</h3>
<p>Python is probably my first (programming) language. I taught myself the basics from various websites when I was in
    grade 6, and used it for various single-file small projects, such as a randomized number-guessing game. I don't
    believe any of these programs still exist. I continued to use it throughout elementary and highschool, building my
    skills and experience with small, self-directed passion projects. The concise syntax, freedom from boilerplate, and
    intuitive English-like language structure are among the reasons that it's my preferred language to this day. I've
    built GUI applications with Tkinter and webapps with Flask. I've used it for my Chemistry classes as an overpowered
    scientific calculator, and in my Linear Algebra classes as a substitute for MATLAB. When I have an assignment in
    another language, like C++ or Java, I will sometimes rewrite the program in Python, thereby cutting the LoC in half.
</p>

<h3>C++</h3>
<p>I first used C++ when I got an Osepp Arduino Uno as a gift, sometime around grade 7. Considering how little I knew
    about circuit design and electrical engineering, it's surprising that the little Uno still works perfectly to this
    day. I've definitely shorted it and mismatched voltages at least a couple of times. My largest Arduino C++ project
    was the <a future-href="/projects/iot-pet-feeder" class=broken-link>IoT smart pet feeder</a> that my team and I
    built for a class project. C++ seems to be the lingua franca of the computer engineering department at SFU, so I've
    taken multiple classes in the language. Some are visible on my {{site.github}}, while others cannot be public.</p>

<h3>Java</h3>
<p>Java is another contender for my first programming language. I was an avid Minecraft player in elementary school, and
    I created a few simple mods for the game. It's written in Java, so to write mods I had to decompile the source with
    Eclipse and make changes to the .jar files. I then abandoned the language until my Data Structures class was centred
    around it. This is the one language that I don't use VS Code for, opting instead for IntelliJ IDEA in light of its
    decompilation and testing coverage abilities.</p>

<h3>VHDL</h3>
<p>Hardware design and digital logic was one of my favourite courses yet. Maybe I liked how I was writing code that was
    close to bare metal than assembly, or maybe it's that I already solve logical puzzles quite similar to common
    hardware problems in my free time. The final project for this course was to create an <a
        future-href="/projects/tensor-core" class=broken-link>ML tensor core</a>,
    which was a joy to build. My ENSC 252 project repo is private for academic honesty, as the
    instructors of some courses are concerned about future students copying work from GitHub, but as long as you aren't
    a student or Chegg, I can give access to anyone that is interested.</p>

<h3>MATLAB</h3>
<p>MATLAB was the required language for ENSC 180, where we used its matrix analysis and calculation tools, along with
    some of the toolkits, including image processing. Unfortunately, my professor has tainted my opinions on MATLAB. I
    can see the power of the environment, and if I was working in one of the fields that MATLAB creates toolboxes for,
    I'm sure I'd love it. However, my passion projects aren't written in MATLAB for a reason.</p>

<h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
<p>Do these count as languages? I suppose they're <a href="https://github.com/efoxepstein/stupid-machines">Turing
        complete</a>, but it doesn't feel right to describe them as programming languages. I'm functional in these
    languages, and can write a website (obviously, or you wouldn't be here), but I wouldn't consider myself an expert by
    a long shot. I first wrote a website when I was experimenting with the Flask python web-server, and I've been
    learning on my own ever since. I follow intelligent, experienced web developers on social media and read their
    blogs, such as <a href="https://css-tricks.com">CSS Tricks</a>. Learn from the best.</p>

<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>This is my most recently acquired language. I use it for basic interactivity on this website (e.g. the theme button
    in the header). In an effort to improve my skills with the language, I'm working on a <a href="/phaser/">video
        game</a> using the Phaser.js game design framework. I'm intrigued by React and Next.js. If you check back later,
    maybe there will be some more of that hosted here.</p>

<h3>Haskell</h3>
<p>This language, and the functional programming paradign in general, are very enticing to me. I have extremely limited
    experience with Haskell, but I've used concepts from functional programming in Python and C++ projects before, and
    it always results in clean, intuitive code. Monads are scary, but maybe one day I'll get around to properly learning
    it.</p>

<h3>Perl</h3>
<p>Whenever I look for information on Perl, I feel like I'm browsing the new-age or self-help sections of my <a
        href="http://pulpfictionbooksvancouver.com/">local used bookstore</a>. The metaprogramming features of this
    language seem very powerful, but I haven't explored this language much.</p>

<h3>LaTeX</h3>
<p>In a similar vein to HTML, this doesn't really count as a language. I've been meaning to learn how to use it for
    academic papers and note-taking in math class, but have been recently stymied by incompatibilities between WSL and
    the VS Code LaTeX extension. If I ever manage to get a local development environment working, I'll update this
    section with a MathJAX rendered LaTeX logo, instead of the bootleg version seen here.</p>

<h3>Dart</h3>
<p>I've experimented with Flutter in the past, and the idea of creating a cross-platform native app from a single
    codebase is quite interesting.</p>


<h2>Operating Systems</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>This is the typical OS that I use day-to-day. I run the latest beta Insiders build, and keep it up to date. I dislike
    it for development, so whenever possible I work with my code using Visual Studio Code running out of Ubuntu on WSL2.
</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>I wish I could use Linux as my primary OS. I love the customizability, and unified package management, and the
    no-safety-rails approach to user experience. I've installed Arch, struggled with <code>GRUB</code> modifications on
    an ornery
    netbook with a 64-bit CPU that can only boot 32-bit UEFIs, and broken more installations than I can remember. I
    tried it for real for a few weeks, with Mint on an old laptop and Manjaro on my main desktop,
    but it doesn't work for a few key features. Whether it's my ENSC courses requiring Quartus or Visio, my projects
    using Ableton and Illustrator, or my hobbies requiring DX12, there's always been some program that flat-out doesn't
    run on Linux. 2021 may be the year of the <a
        href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/aerospace/robotic-exploration/nasa-designed-perseverance-helicopter-rover-fly-autonomously-mars">
        Linux Marstop</a>, but <code>$NEXT_YEAR</code> will always be the year of the Linux desktop.</p>

<h3>FreeBSD</h3>
<p>I really dislike FreeBSD. My main server runs it, and any time I have to interact with FreeBSD directly, I die a
    little inside. The ports system is backwards compared to <code>apt</code> or <code>pacman</code>, and
    <code>pkg</code> is hardly better. Jails without <code>vim</code> installed was a particularly frustrating pain
    point until I realized I could just use <code>vi</code>. It probably didn't help that I spent a weekend debugging
    the server remotely, over an <code>ssh</code> connection with multi-second latency.
</p>

<h3>macOS</h3>
<p>I don't actively use macOS, but, as the resident unpaid tech support for my family, I'm required to keep at least
    somewhat familiar with the operating system. If I needed a regular laptop and had the budget for one, I'd probably
    get an M1 Macbook Air. However, my main usecases for computers involve either multiple monitors (desktop) or
    touchscreen writing/drawing (convertible laptop), neither of which are <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path">happy paths</a> for Macs.</p>

<h3>Android</h3>
<p>My phone runs Android 11, and I've written a couple apps in Java and Kotlin.</p>
