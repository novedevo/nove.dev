    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I'm a computer engineering student located in Vancouver, BC and studying at <a href="https://sfu.ca/"
            title="SFU">Simon Fraser University</a>.
        My interests include music, hiking, coding and video games. Python + VS Code + WSL2 = development joy.
        In my spare time, I can sometimes be found solving puzzles such as nonograms, shikaku, and crosswords.
        My passion projects include game design and development using Phaser, home network architecture in the
        <a href="https://unifi-network.ui.com/" title="Unifi">Unifi</a> ecosystem, and home server
        architecture under FreeBSD (soon to be Debian) with <a href="https://www.truenas.com/"
            title="TrueNAS">TrueNAS</a>. I'm currently taking a course on data structures and algorithms using Java, and
        I have experience in C, C++, Python, HTML/CSS/JS, and hardware design using VHDL and Quartus.

    <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The code for most of my work can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/novedevo">GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Any classes that I took in university have repos there, however some cannot be public due to instructor
        concerns
        about academic honesty.
        This includes courses on C++, Java, and VHDL. If you're interested in reading over my coursework, <a

    </p>
    <p>Some of my web-based projects are hosted on this website: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>This website itself. Written in HTML5/CSS3/JS and preprocessed by Jekyll through GitHub Pages.
            Source: <a href="https://github.com/novedevo/novedevo.github.io">website source code</a>
        </li>
        <li>HTML5 video game development using the Phaser framework. This is a rapidly evolving project as
            I learn more about game design and JavaScript. Hosted at the <a href="/phaser">phaser section</a> of this
            website.
