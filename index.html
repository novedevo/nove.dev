    <h1 id="home">Devon Sawatsky Burnham</h1>
    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a computer engineering student, located in Vancouver, BC, and studying at <a href="https://sfu.ca/" title="SFU">Simon Fraser
            University</a>.
        My interests include music, hiking, coding and video games. My preferred language is Python, and I use VS
        Code and IntelliJ IDEA.
        My passion projects include game design and development using Phaser, home network architecture in the
        <a href="https://unifi-network.ui.com/" title="Unifi">Unifi</a> ecosystem, and home server
        architecture
        under FreeBSD (soon to be Debian) with <a href="https://www.truenas.com/" title="TrueNAS">TrueNAS</a>.
        I'm currently taking a course on data structures and algorithms using Java, and I have experience in C, C++,
        Python, HTML/CSS/JS,
        and hardware design using VHDL and Quartus.
    </p>

    <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
    <p>The code for most of my work can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/novedevo">GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Any classes that I took in university have repos there, however some cannot be public due to instructor
        concerns
        about academic honesty.
        This includes courses on C++, Java, and VHDL. If you're interested in reading over my coursework, <a
            href="#contact">contact me</a>!
    </p>
    <p>Some of this is also hosted on this website: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>This website itself. Written in HTML5/CSS3/JS and preprocessed by Jekyll through GitHub Pages. You found it!

        </li>
        <li>HTML5 video game development using the Phaser framework. This is a rapidly evolving project as
            I learn more about game design and JavaScript. Hosted at <a
