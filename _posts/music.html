<p>I like to make music, but I don't have as much spare time to devote to it as I'd like. Some of it is out there, but
    none of it is especially good by my standards. As such, you may not listen to
    any of it. I use Ableton with a miscellany of free VSTs and an old midi keyboard.</p>
<p>I technically made the soundtrack for the Phaser demo game on this website. It's an 8 second loop, two notes an
    octave apart, a Massive arpeggiator, a bitcrusher, and way too much Opus compression. The ears bleed.</p>
<p>If you want to listen to the same music I do, try <a
