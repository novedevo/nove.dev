# nove.dev

...is my personal website, showcasing a selection of my projects, skills, and hobbies. Hosted at [nove.dev](https://nove.dev/).

I use Zola for static site generation, Sass for styling, and Cloudflare for hosting and networking. There's also lots of Tera, Markdown, and vanilla HTML/CSS/JS involved.
