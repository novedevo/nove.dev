## About Me
***

I'm a computer engineering student located in Vancouver, BC and studying at Simon Fraser University.
I have experience in Java, Rust, C++, Python, HTML/CSS/JS, and hardware design using VHDL and Quartus.
I've built various projects with Arduino, ESP8266, and Raspberry Pi, and I've worked with AutoCAD and Inventor.
My passion projects include home server architecture using Docker & Kubernetes under Debian Linux (formerly FreeBSD) with TrueNAS, home network architecture in the Unifi ecosystem, game design, and music production.
I love learning new things and working on accessibility.
My interests include music, hiking, coding and video games.
In my spare time, I like solving puzzles such as nonograms, shikaku, and crosswords.
