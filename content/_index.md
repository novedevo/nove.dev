## About Me
***

I'm a computer engineering student located in Vancouver, BC and studying at <a href="https://sfu.ca/" title="SFU">Simon Fraser University</a>. 
My interests include music, hiking, coding and video games.
I love learning new things and working on accessibility.
In my spare time, I like solving puzzles such as nonograms, shikaku, and crosswords. 
My passion projects include music production, game design, home network architecture in the <a href="https://unifi-network.ui.com/" title="Unifi">Unifi</a> ecosystem, and home server architecture using Docker & Kubernetes under Debian (formerly FreeBSD) with <a href="https://www.truenas.com/" title="TrueNAS">TrueNAS</a>. 
I have experience in Java, Rust, C++, Python, HTML/CSS/JS, and hardware design using VHDL and Quartus.
I've built various projects with Arduino, ESP8266, and Raspberry Pi, and I've worked with AutoCAD and Inventor.

## Projects
***

The code for most of my work can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/novedevo">GitHub</a>.

Any classes that I took in university have repos there. This includes courses on C++, Java, and VHDL.

Some of my web-based projects are hosted on this website, others don't fit here.
In no particular order, they include: 

- This website itself. Written in Markdown, HTML5/CSS3/JS and preprocessed by Zola through Cloudflare Pages.
Source: <a href="https://github.com/novedevo/novedevo.github.io">website source code</a>
- Hangman guessing engine, written in Rust and Javascript, hosted on Oracle cloud
- Video game development using the Phaser JavaScript framework. 
It's in early stages of development, but I host it at the <a href="/phaser">phaser section</a> of this website.
Source: <a href="https://github.com/novedevo/novedevo.github.io/tree/master/phaser">phaser source code</a>
- A tensor core, similar to those found in machine learning-focussed products from the likes of Nvidia, written in VHDL.
The code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/novedevo/ENSC-252/tree/master/final">GitHub</a>
- Software lead on an IoT pet feeder.
This involved systems design, interacting with cloud services and an Android app, and writing lots of C++.
As software lead, my role also involved coordination between teammates, project management, and "devops" such as showing people Git.
- CAD model of an innovative multi-axis FDM 3D printer, to produce objects with less supports and more resistance to delamination.
This was a capstone project for an engineering design class.
I used Autodesk Inventor to model and simulate the design.
