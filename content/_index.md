## About Me
***

I'm a computer engineering student located in Vancouver, BC and studying at [Simon Fraser University](https://sfu.ca/ "SFU").
My interests include music, hiking, coding and video games.
I love learning new things and working on accessibility.
In my spare time, I like solving puzzles such as nonograms, shikaku, and crosswords. 
My passion projects include music production, game design, home network architecture in the [Unifi](https://unifi-network.ui.com/ "Unifi") ecosystem, and home server architecture using Docker & Kubernetes under Debian (formerly FreeBSD) with [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com/ "TrueNAS").
I have experience in Java, Rust, C++, Python, HTML/CSS/JS, and hardware design using VHDL and Quartus.
I've built various projects with Arduino, ESP8266, and Raspberry Pi, and I've worked with AutoCAD and Inventor.

## Projects
***

The code for most of my work can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/novedevo).

Any classes that I took in university have repos there. This includes courses on C++, Java, and VHDL.
