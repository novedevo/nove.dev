as is tradition, now that i've stripped my old website to the bones, my first post must be about the  technology that made the new website. if i am to follow in my priors' footsteps, this will also be the last post on this blog. i endeavour to not.

both this site and my old site use the zola static site generator. my old site was laden with plenty of custom css, unpopular ideas about fonts, and altogether too much self-importance. this current site uses the stock terminimal theme with no adjustments, so hopefully i can actually write posts instead of screwing around with css. at least i've kept the theme colour.

    <p>i originally used pure CMYK magenta, on the hubristic idea that one day my resume would be printed on a colour printer. i don't think that has ever happened, and it's weird for a computer professional to have a dead-trees-focused resume. it also was (is) too bombastic. after i'm happy with this site, i'll rewrite my resume in typst with a basic theme. it'll be linked here, eventually.</p>

        <p>i lightly wish terminimal had asides. i'm not convinced they work on mobile, at all - it requires a certain width of reading area that mobile lacks completely. still, they work in a similar way to my brain. this is a nested aside, not that it renders that way. i'm polyfilling with details tags. i wonder how i expect a doubly-nested aside to work</p>

zola's pretty good, if a little obtuse with its sections-and-pages systematization. it could use better error messages, but it really didn't take too long to refamiliarize myself with after not touching it for years, and now it's mostly staying out of my way. i like the terminimal theme, partially from association with other blogs i respect. i appreciate the lack of javascript.
