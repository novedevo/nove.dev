last year i never did any aoc, though i've been [retroactively working](https://tangled.org/nove.dev/aoc-2024) on some of the problems. this year i'll do it!

i always aspire to complete the whole month and get stymied partway through. hopefully this year will be different :) i will show more persistence and do more background research on the compsci fundamentals; maybe i'll write some abstracted algorithms or data structures to do frequent tasks. the recommended reading below is mostly for myself!

i'm putting [my solutions](https://tangled.org/nove.dev/aoc-2025) on tangled, writing in rust, using jujutsu for version control, and a nix flake for a dev environment. it's a good mix of low-friction while still using new tools that i want to be better at. plus, i don't use rust at work much anymore, so i need to keep the proverbial rust off.

recommended reading: 
1. [this comment](https://lobste.rs/c/6lunsz) on [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs), which discusses strategies if you find yourself stuck, common data structurs & algorithms, and textbooks to read for more of a theory background
2. [elly's post](https://elly.town/d/blog/2025-09-01-advent-of-code-500.html), elly's solved every aoc out there and has good advice
