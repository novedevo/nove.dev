I like to make music, but I don't have as much spare time to devote to it as I'd like. 
Some of it is out there, but none of it is especially good by my standards. 
As such, I don't recommend listening to any of it. 
I use Ableton Live Suite 10 with a miscellany of free VSTs and an old midi keyboard.

I made the soundtrack for the Phaser demo game on this website. 
It's an 8 second loop, two notes an octave apart, a Massive stepper, a bitcrusher, and way too much Opus compression. 
The ears bleed.

If you want to listen to the same music I do, try <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5ZfRZFsE3rZOOad7zv8fCt">Venetian Snares</a>, <!-- <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3ZJmTuWDjMVIFrTs3yxzGv">Dreamcrusher</a>, <a href="https://blackdresses.bandcamp.com/album/peaceful-as-hell">Black Dresses</a>,  --> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4ggb2Ec8PqtoPHnpzXwQb6">Tycho</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6gDtROOIYa6OQxwhDNkDRM">Car Seat Headrest</a>.
