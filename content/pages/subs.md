i have a few subdomains of this website:
- [watertable](https://watertable.nove.dev): senior-friendly public data visualizer, built to let my grandparents and their friends know when they have to conserve water lest their wells run dry.
- [fanged-ebooks](https://fanged-ebooks.nove.dev): i trained two markov chains, one on jacques lacan's ecrits and one on nick land's writings from fanged noumena. i think it's amusing to see their outputs juxtaposed. the initial quotes are real excerpts from each work (they both talk about markov!), but after you click the "get new quotes" button, it pulls a random markov string from a list of about a thousand i pregenerated. content warning for psychoanalytic babble from lacan and sex, drugs, and fascism from nick land. i do not endorse either.
- [bottomsters](https://bottomsters.nove.dev): pulls your [last.fm](https://last.fm) data and renders a grid of your most listened-to albums. inspired by a similar app called topsters, of which there has been many iterations. this was built at a time when the predominant topsters was run by a frothing-at-the-mouth fascist; i do not say that lightly. i did not feel comfortable using his website, so i built my own. my friend genny helped significantly with the frontend, for which i am thankful.
