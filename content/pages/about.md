i'm devon, typically. i'm a software developer who works in various languages for fun and profit; see my [github](https://github.com/novedevo) or [tangled](https://tangled.org/@nove.dev) for some of my public projects. rust is preferred, but c# pays the bills. my collaborators generally find me pretty good at writing code.

- correct, performant, soon: [pick all three or get none](https://loup-vaillant.fr/articles/good-fast-cheap)
- [parse, don't validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)
- [slocs are spent, not produced](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html#:~:text=My%20point,ledger)
- real 10x devs don't write much code
- etc

i try to use jujutsu and helix and tangled instead of git and vscode and github; at work i use git and jetbrains.

i have many social media accounts, despite disliking most social media platforms. you can find me under @novedevo on most, or @nove.dev on atproto (bsky, tangled). i used to use cohost, which i enjoyed more than most other sites. these days i have a tiny account on a tinier instance in a remote corner of the fediverse, where i stay cozy and warm.

you can send me emails! use this website ([nove.dev](https://nove.dev)) as the domain, and anything you like[^1] as the local-part - i have a wildcard redirect set up. you can also send me dms on whatever platform you please.

i have much unreleased electronic music of various qualities, in addition to one ancient ep on bandcamp, if you can find it. i also listen to a lot of music. add me on last.fm, rym, bandcamp<s>, soulseek, spotify</s>?

i typically dress as a cat on halloween. a disproportionate number of my friends are furries. take that how you will.

i live in vancouver, canada. i try to go for at least one hike in the surrounding mountains per week. i learn as much as i can about native plants, fungi, and birds. i don't have a drivers' licence for a variety of reasons, so i bike and take transit.

trans rights, free palestine, blm, slava ukraini, eat the rich, etc.

i use they/them pronouns. i consider myself nonbinary due to political beliefs and gender dysphoria. i think that human experience is better understood through a lens of multiple interacting agents than the myth of the unified self. a major facet of my internal experience is non-linguistic. in fewer words: we're lichen.
