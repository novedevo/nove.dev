i'm devon, typically. i'm a software developer who works in various languages for fun and profit; see my github or tangled for some of my public projects. rust is preferred, but c# pays the bills. my collaborators generally find me pretty good at writing code.

- correct, performant, soon: pick all three or get none
- parse, don't validate
- etc

i try to use jujutsu and helix and tangled instead of git and vscode and github; at work i use git and jetbrains.

i have many social media accounts, despite disliking most social media platforms. you can find me under @novedevo on most, or @nove.dev on atproto.

you can send me emails! use this website ([nove.dev](https://nove.dev)) as the domain, and anything you like[^1] as the local-part - i have a wildcard redirect set up. you can also send me dms on whatever platform you please.

i have much unreleased electronic music of various qualities, in addition to one ancient ep on bandcamp, if you can find it.

trans rights, free palestine, eat the rich, etc. please employ me anyway?

[^1]: well, anything cloudflare and google think is a valid local-part. no one appreciates standards these days
