written in vscode, [stored in github](https://github.com/novedevo/nove.dev), generated by zola, and hosted on cloudflare. i use software in the small for fun, but for things i want to last a long time without payment or maintenance, megacorps appear to be the only solution at the moment.

no generative ai was used in the making of this site. llms delenda est.

theme is [terminimal](https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal/) by pawroman; slight modifications by me
