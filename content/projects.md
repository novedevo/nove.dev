My projects can be broadly broken into two categories: independent and school-directed. There is some overlap, for instance, my Rust Hour project began as a rewrite of a Java-based class project. 
Some of my independent projects begin with a need, such as my home server, and others begin with a desire to learn a new technology, such as the Hangman bot.
